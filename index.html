            <h2>Remembering Amrita </h2>

                    <h3> Amrita Sher-Gil: Portrait of an Artist as a Young Woman
                    </h3>
                    <p>Sher-Gil knew the power of a stylised public image but her life was dedicated to her art.
                        Remembering a pioneer of modern Indian art on her 110th birthday. In the letters that painter
                        Amrita
                        Sher-Gil wrote to friends and family, two subjects crisscross like lace-work. Her belief that
                        her
                        art was Indian because its spirit was Indian even though she was of mixed parentage—and her
                        excitement over the new fashions with which she would project her public persona. Her parents,
                        and
                        at times, her sister Indira, were willing partners in the creation of this personal style—two of
                        Sher-Gil’s most known photographs, clicked by her father Umrao Singh, show her in a sari with a
                        broad embellished border and paired with a brocade blouse, and another standing in the sun in a
                        sari
                        speckled with gold butis. Friends from the art fraternity were also drafted into this
                        image-making.
                        For instance, Karl Khandalavala, a well-known Bombay (now Mumbai) art critic, who was one of her
                        strongest and early champions. In a letter to him outlining her progress on a large-format
                        painting,
                        the conversation segues into a playful “So you like my new cape?”, and back to a self-portrait
                        she
                        had made which, she suggested, could be used with a piece in the Illustrated Weekly on her
                        talents
                        as a portrait painter. <a

                    <h3> Amrita Sher-Gil’s Apartment 23 and her last days in Lahore</h3>
                    <p>Along the Ganga Ram Trust Building on The Mall, a small street leads to a neighbourhood that had
                        once the house of Amrita Sher-Gil, the most famous woman painter of the united India. The small
                        neighbourhood that has somehow survived the test of time is called Ganga Ram Mansions. The
                        magnificent Dyal Singh Mansion is also adjacent to it. <a
